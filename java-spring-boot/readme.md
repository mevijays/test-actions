I've created a Spring Boot application that implements your requirements. Here's a breakdown of the key components:

Backend Components:

ConfigurationScript model for storing script metadata
GCSService for handling Google Cloud Storage operations
ConfigurationService for managing script deployments
REST Controller with protected endpoints


Security Features:

Role-based access control for deploy/revert operations
Timestamp-based versioning
Transaction management for script execution


Storage:

Oracle database for application data
GCS bucket for SQL script storage
Organized folder structure by timestamp



To implement the frontend, you'll need to create:

A script editor page with:

Multiple text areas for SQL input
Save button that triggers the /api/config/save endpoint
Timestamp display for saved versions


A deployment page with:

List of available script versions
Deploy button calling /api/config/deploy/{timestamp}
Revert button calling /api/config/revert
